-- This workflow is intended to be run as a HOOK workflow.
-- This workflow job is shipped with Komodo
-- https://fmu-docs.equinor.com/docs/ert/reference/workflows/added_workflow_jobs.html#WF_CREATE_CASE_METADATA

-- The workflow name is prefixed "xhook" to signal that even if it appears in the ERT
-- workflow dropdown, it is not supposed to be ran by the user. Also, the "x" in front
-- makes it go to the bottom of the drop-down. When having many HOOK workflows, it is
-- annoying that they take up a lot of space in the ERT dropdown. This is NOT the case
-- in Drogon, with very few workflows, but the routine is useful for setups in the wild.
